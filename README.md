My work on the programming assignments for the course CSE 568-Robotics Algorithms at UB.
Course Outline and Objectives:
At the end of this course, a successful student should be able to understand and
reason about:
1- Mobility: Wheeled locomotion
2- Kinematics: Wheeled kinematics, coordinate transforms
3- Sensing: Various sensors, sensor classification and sensor characterization
4- Sensing: Range sensing and line fitting algorithms, range histograms.
5- Sensing: Vision, image formation, camera model, perspective projection.
6- Sensing: Image processing
7- Sensing: Structure from stereo
8- Probabilistic modeling of robot localization and mapping
9- Estimation: General Bayesâ€™ formulation of reasoning under uncertain conditions
10-Estimation: Specific formulation of localization and mapping
11-Planning: given a map, understand how a robot can navigate from a location to
another location.
12-Planning: Randomized algorithms for planning
13-Task allocation: In multi-robot systems, study algorithms that allow robots to
perform task allocation.
14-Applications: Study full multi-robot systems in deployment/research that
combine all the algorithms learnt in this class and beyond.
