My work on the programming assignments for the course CSE 568-Robotics Algorithms at UB.
Course Outline and Objectives:
At the end of this course, a successful student should be able to understand and
reason about:
1- Mobility: Wheeled locomotion<br/>
2- Kinematics: Wheeled kinematics, coordinate transforms<br/>
3- Sensing: Various sensors, sensor classification and sensor characterization<br/>
4- Sensing: Range sensing and line fitting algorithms, range histograms.<br/>
5- Sensing: Vision, image formation, camera model, perspective projection.<br/>
6- Sensing: Image processing<br/>
7- Sensing: Structure from stereo<br/>
8- Probabilistic modeling of robot localization and mapping<br/>
9- Estimation: General Bayesâ€™ formulation of reasoning under uncertain conditions<br/>
10-Estimation: Specific formulation of localization and mapping<br/>
11-Planning: given a map, understand how a robot can navigate from a location to another location.<br/>
12-Planning: Randomized algorithms for planning<br/>
13-Task allocation: In multi-robot systems, study algorithms that allow robots to perform task allocation.<br/>
14-Applications: Study full multi-robot systems in deployment/research that combine all the algorithms learnt in this class and beyond.<br/>
